This project aims to develop a movie Recommender system, using the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) matrix factor- ization algorithm, capable of delivering personalized rec- ommendations to users despite the amount of user data available to us through implicit or explicit feedback.

Specifically, the system should accurately predict a userâ€™s rating for a given movie and recommend movies they are likely to enjoy while entertaining new movies different from what they used to but would love.
